# Spectre Guide — Adapted to Your Context

Guide users based on HOW they work, not just WHAT they want to build.

## Philosophy

Different contexts need different workflows:
- **Product Team** → Full process, specs, reviews, compliance
- **Startup** → Fast iterations, ship & learn
- **Freelance** → Efficient, focused, no overhead

---

## The Flow

### Step 1: What's Your Work Context?

**First time only** (remember for the session):

```
Question: "What's your work context?"
Header: "Context"
Options:
  1. "Product Team / Enterprise"
     Description: "Specs, process, reviews, multiple stakeholders"
  2. "Startup / Small Team"
     Description: "Fast iterations, agile, ship & learn"
  3. "Freelance / Solo"
     Description: "Efficient, focused, minimal overhead"
  4. "Learning / Exploring"
     Description: "Trying things out, no pressure"
```

---

### Step 2: What Do You Want to Do?

```
Question: "What do you want to do?"
Header: "Goal"
Options:
  1. "Build something new"
     Description: "New feature, component, or functionality"
  2. "Fix something"
     Description: "Bug, error, failing tests"
  3. "Improve existing code"
     Description: "Refactor, add tests, clean up"
  4. "Think / Design"
     Description: "Architecture, planning, decisions"
```

---

### Step 3: Context-Specific Questions

#### If "Build something new"

**For Product Team / Enterprise:**

```
Question: "What do you have to start with?"
Header: "Input"
Options:
  1. "A PRD or feature spec"
     Description: "Product requirements document, Jira ticket, detailed spec"
  2. "A user story or brief"
     Description: "High-level requirement, needs refinement"
  3. "Just a concept"
     Description: "Idea that needs to be specced out"
```

Then:
```
Question: "What part of the system?"
Header: "Domain"
Options:
  1. "Frontend / UI"
  2. "Backend / API"
  3. "Full-stack"
```

**For Startup / Small Team:**

```
Question: "How clear are the requirements?"
Header: "Clarity"
Options:
  1. "Crystal clear — let's build"
     Description: "I know exactly what to do"
  2. "Mostly clear — might need quick design"
     Description: "90% there, need to figure out some details"
  3. "Rough idea — need to shape it"
     Description: "Know the goal, need to define the how"
```

Then:
```
Question: "Frontend, backend, or both?"
Header: "Stack"
Options:
  1. "Frontend"
  2. "Backend"
  3. "Both"
```

**For Freelance / Solo:**

```
Question: "What are you building?"
Header: "Stack"
Options:
  1. "UI / Frontend"
  2. "API / Backend"
  3. "Full-stack"
```

Then:
```
Question: "Testing?"
Header: "Quality"
Options:
  1. "Yes, with tests (Recommended)"
     Description: "QA agent verifies your work"
  2. "No, ship it"
     Description: "Just the implementation"
```

**For Learning / Exploring:**

```
Question: "What are you exploring?"
Header: "Area"
Options:
  1. "Frontend / React"
  2. "Backend / API"
  3. "Architecture patterns"
  4. "Testing practices"
```

→ Suggest appropriate craft skill directly

## Mapping Tables

### Product Team / Enterprise

| Input | Domain | Agents Chain |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| PRD/Spec | Frontend | `Architect → frontend-dev → QA` |
| PRD/Spec | Backend | `Architect → backend-dev → QA` |
| PRD/Spec | Full-stack | `Architect → backend-dev → frontend-dev → QA` |
| User story/Brief | Any | `PO (refine) → Architect → Dev → QA` |
| Just a concept | Any | `PO (full spec) → Architect → Dev → QA` |

**Characteristics:**
- Always includes architect for design review
- Always includes QA for testing
- PO refines unclear requirements
- Full documentation trail

### Startup / Small Team

| Clarity | Stack | Agents Chain |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| Crystal clear | Frontend | `frontend-dev → QA` |
| Crystal clear | Backend | `backend-dev → QA` |
| Crystal clear | Full-stack | `backend-dev → frontend-dev → QA` |
| Mostly clear | Any | `Architect (quick) → Dev → QA` |
| Rough idea | Any | `Architect → Dev → QA` |

**Characteristics:**
- Skip PO — you ARE the PO
- Architect only when needed
- Always QA for quality
- Fast feedback loop

### Freelance / Solo

| Stack | Testing | Agents Chain |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| Frontend | Yes | `frontend-dev → QA` |
| Frontend | No | `frontend-dev` |
| Backend | Yes | `backend-dev → QA` |
| Backend | No | `backend-dev` |
| Full-stack | Yes | `backend-dev → frontend-dev → QA` |
| Full-stack | No | `backend-dev → frontend-dev` |

**Characteristics:**
- Direct to implementation
- Testing is optional (but recommended)
- Minimal overhead
- Maximum efficiency

### Learning / Exploring

| Area | Action |
|------|--------|
| Frontend/React | `/react-craft` |
| Backend/API | Use `software-craftsman` for guidance |
| Architecture | `/agent software-craftsman` |
| Testing | `/test-craft` |

**Characteristics:**
- Educational mode
- Single agent or skill
- No pressure
- Explanations prioritized

## Step 4: Get Task Description

Context-appropriate prompt:

**Product Team:**
```
"Paste the PRD/spec or describe the feature:"
```

**Startup:**
```
"What are you building? (Keep it brief)"
```

**Freelance:**
```
"What do you need?"
```

**Learning:**
```
"What do you want to learn about?"
```

---

## Step 5: Confirm and Launch

Show context-appropriate summary:

### Product Team Example

```markdown
## Workflow for: User Authentication Feature

**Context:** Product Team / Enterprise
**Input:** PRD provided
**Domain:** Full-stack

### Agents Pipeline:

┌────────────────┐     ┌────────────────┐     ┌────────────────┐     ┌────────────────┐
│   Architect    │ ──▶ │  backend-dev   │ ──▶ │  frontend-dev  │ ──▶ │  qa-engineer   │
│                │     │                │     │                │     │                │
│ • Tech design  │     │ • API          │     │ • UI           │     │ • Tests        │
│ • Data model   │     │ • Auth logic   │     │ • Forms        │     │ • Verification │
│ • Security     │     │ • Validation   │     │ • State        │     │ • Compliance   │
└────────────────┘     └────────────────┘     └────────────────┘     └───────┬────────┘
                                                      ▲                      │
                                                      └──── fix & retry ─────┘

**Output:** Tech spec → Implementation → Tested code
```

### Startup Example

```markdown
## Quick Build: Login Form

**Context:** Startup / Fast iteration
**Clarity:** Crystal clear
**Stack:** Frontend

### Agents:

┌────────────────┐     ┌────────────────┐
│  frontend-dev  │ ──▶ │  qa-engineer   │
│                │     │                │
│ Build it       │     │ Test it        │
└────────────────┘     └───────┬────────┘
        ▲                      │
        └──── loop if needed ──┘

**Time to first feedback:** Fast ⚡
```

### Freelance Example

```markdown
## Task: Add Payment Form

**Context:** Freelance / Efficient
**Stack:** Frontend
**Testing:** Yes

### Agent:

frontend-dev → qa-engineer (verify)

**Approach:** Direct implementation with quality check.
```

## Smart Context Detection

If user provides hints, detect context:

| Signal | Detected Context |
|--------|------------------|
| "PRD", "Jira", "spec", "requirements doc" | Product Team |
| "quick", "MVP", "ship it", "iterate" | Startup |
| "client", "project", "deadline" | Freelance |
| "learn", "try", "explore", "understand" | Learning |

---

## Remember Context

Store context for the session:

```json
// .spectre/context.json
{
  "workContext": "startup",
  "defaultStack": "frontend",
  "preferTesting": true
}
```

On subsequent `/guide` calls, skip Step 1 and use stored context.

To change: `/guide --reset` or answer "Other" to change context.
