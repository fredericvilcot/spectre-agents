# Spectre Craft — Adapted to Your Context

Craft features based on HOW you work, not just WHAT you want to build.

## Philosophy

Different contexts need different workflows:
- **Product Team** → Full process, specs, reviews, compliance
- **Startup** → Fast iterations, ship & learn
- **Freelance** → Efficient, focused, no overhead

---

## Step 0: Stack Detection + Pattern Learning (2 phases distinctes)

**Before asking any questions**, two separate phases:

### Phase 1: STACK DETECTION (toujours exécuté)

Détecte le stack technique. **Indépendant des violations.**
Même si le code est pourri, on sait quand même que c'est du TypeScript/Go/Rust.

### Phase 2: PATTERN LEARNING (peut être bloqué)

Apprend les patterns du projet. **STOP sur violations.**
Si bloqué → agents utilisent les craft defaults pour le stack détecté.

### Phase 1: Stack Detection (ALWAYS)

#### Case A: Existing Project → Auto-Detect

```bash
# Check for stack indicators
if [ -f "package.json" ]; then
  STACK="node"
  grep -q "react" package.json && FRAMEWORK="react"
  grep -q "vue" package.json && FRAMEWORK="vue"
  [ -f "tsconfig.json" ] && LANGUAGE="typescript" || LANGUAGE="javascript"
elif [ -f "go.mod" ]; then
  STACK="go" && LANGUAGE="go"
elif [ -f "Cargo.toml" ]; then
  STACK="rust" && LANGUAGE="rust"
elif [ -f "pyproject.toml" ]; then
  STACK="python" && LANGUAGE="python"
elif [ -f "pom.xml" ] || [ -f "build.gradle" ]; then
  STACK="jvm" && LANGUAGE="java"
fi
```

#### Case B: Empty/New Project → Guide Stack Selection

If no stack detected, **ask the user**:

```
Question: "What stack are you building with?"
Header: "Stack"
Options:
  1. "TypeScript + React"
     Description: "Frontend with React, Vite, Vitest"
  2. "TypeScript + Node"
     Description: "Backend with Node.js, Express/Fastify"
  3. "Go"
     Description: "Backend with Go, standard library or Gin/Echo"
  4. "Rust"
     Description: "Systems or backend with Rust"
  5. "Python"
     Description: "Backend with FastAPI/Django/Flask"
  6. "Other"
     Description: "Specify your stack"
```

Then ask for more specifics:

```
# If TypeScript + React:
Question: "Any preferences?"
Header: "Setup"
Options:
  1. "Full setup (Recommended)"
     Description: "Vite + Vitest + TailwindCSS + strict TS"
  2. "Minimal"
     Description: "Just React + TypeScript"
  3. "With state management"
     Description: "Add Zustand + React Query"
```

#### Store Stack Context (Phase 1 Result)

```bash
mkdir -p .spectre

cat > .spectre/context.json << EOF
{
  "stack": {
    "language": "$LANGUAGE",
    "runtime": "$STACK",
    "framework": "$FRAMEWORK",
    "setup": "$SETUP"
  },
  "learning": {
    "enabled": true,
    "scope": "project",
    "status": "pending"
  },
  "fromScratch": $FROM_SCRATCH,
  "detectedAt": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
}
EOF
```

---

### Phase 2: Pattern Learning (MAY BE BLOCKED)

**Only runs if project has existing code.**

```bash
if [ "$FROM_SCRATCH" = "false" ] && [ "$LEARNING_ENABLED" = "true" ]; then
  # Scan for patterns
  # Apply craft guard
  # If violations → STOP, report, ask user
  # If clean → store patterns
fi
```

#### On Violation: What Happens

```
🔍 Learning patterns...

🛑 CRAFT VIOLATIONS DETECTED

   src/services/UserService.ts:45
   → throw new Error('User not found')
   → Violates: Explicit Error Handling

📋 Report: .spectre/violations-report.md

⚠️  Stack detected: TypeScript + React
✅  Agents will use CRAFT DEFAULTS for TypeScript + React
❌  Project patterns NOT learned (violations blocked)

   [ 🔧 Fix violations ]  [ ⏭️ Continue anyway ]  [ 🛑 Stop ]
```

#### Context After Violation

```json
{
  "stack": {
    "language": "typescript",
    "runtime": "node",
    "framework": "react"
  },
  "learning": {
    "enabled": true,
    "status": "blocked",
    "reason": "violations",
    "violationCount": 2
  }
}
```

**Agents still know the stack.** They use craft defaults instead of project patterns.

---

### Agent Knowledge by Stack

Agents adapt to detected stack with **craft defaults**:

| Stack | Architect Defaults | Engineer Defaults |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **TS + React** | Hooks, composition, explicit props | Testing Library, a11y, strict types |
| **TS + Node** | Ports/adapters, DI, Result types | Zod validation, explicit errors |
| **Go** | Interfaces, error returns, small packages | Table tests, standard lib |
| **Rust** | Traits, Result/Option, ownership | Cargo test, no unwrap |
| **Python** | Type hints, protocols, dataclasses | pytest, explicit returns |

---

### Summary: What Agents Get

| Situation | Stack | Patterns | Source |
|-----------|-------|----------|--------|
| Clean project | ✅ Detected | ✅ Learned | Project |
| Violations found | ✅ Detected | ❌ Blocked | Craft defaults |
| From scratch | ✅ Selected | — | Craft defaults |
| Learning disabled | ✅ Detected | — | Craft defaults |

---

## Step 4: Get Task Description

Context-appropriate prompt:

**Product Team:**
```
"Paste the PRD/spec or describe the feature:"
```

**Startup:**
```
"What are you building? (Keep it brief)"
```

**Freelance:**
```
"What do you need?"
```

**Learning:**
```
"What do you want to learn about?"
```

---

## Step 5: Confirm and Launch

Show context-appropriate summary:

### Product Team Example

```markdown
## Workflow for: User Authentication Feature

**Context:** Product Team / Enterprise
**Input:** PRD provided
**Domain:** Full-stack

### Agents Pipeline:

┌────────────────┐     ┌────────────────┐     ┌────────────────┐     ┌────────────────┐
│   Architect    │ ──▶ │  backend-engineer   │ ──▶ │  frontend-engineer  │ ──▶ │  qa-engineer   │
│                │     │                │     │                │     │                │
│ • Tech design  │     │ • API          │     │ • UI           │     │ • Tests        │
│ • Data model   │     │ • Auth logic   │     │ • Forms        │     │ • Verification │
│ • Security     │     │ • Validation   │     │ • State        │     │ • Compliance   │
└────────────────┘     └────────────────┘     └────────────────┘     └───────┬────────┘
                                                      ▲                      │
                                                      └──── fix & retry ─────┘

**Output:** Tech spec → Implementation → Tested code
```

### Startup Example

```markdown
## Quick Build: Login Form

**Context:** Startup / Fast iteration
**Clarity:** Crystal clear
**Stack:** Frontend

### Agents:

┌────────────────┐     ┌────────────────┐
│  frontend-engineer  │ ──▶ │  qa-engineer   │
│                │     │                │
│ Build it       │     │ Test it        │
└────────────────┘     └───────┬────────┘
        ▲                      │
        └──── loop if needed ──┘

**Time to first feedback:** Fast ⚡
```

### Freelance Example

```markdown
## Task: Add Payment Form

**Context:** Freelance / Efficient
**Stack:** Frontend
**Testing:** Yes

### Agent:

frontend-engineer → qa-engineer (verify)

**Approach:** Direct implementation with quality check.
```

## Smart Context Detection

If user provides hints, detect context:

| Signal | Detected Context |
|--------|------------------|
| "PRD", "Jira", "spec", "requirements doc" | Product Team |
| "quick", "MVP", "ship it", "iterate" | Startup |
| "client", "project", "deadline" | Freelance |
| "learn", "try", "explore", "understand" | Learning |

---

## Remember Context

Store context for the session:

```json
// .spectre/context.json
{
  "workContext": "startup",
  "defaultStack": "frontend",
  "preferTesting": true
}
```

On subsequent `/craft` calls, skip Step 1 and use stored context.

To change: `/craft --reset` or answer "Other" to change context.

## Agent Invocation

### How to Spawn Agents

Use the **Task tool** with the appropriate `subagent_type`:

```
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "architect"
  prompt: "Design the technical architecture for: <task>"
```

### Available Agent Types

| Agent | subagent_type | Use For |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| Product Owner | `product-owner` | User stories, specs, acceptance criteria |
| Architect | `architect` | Architecture, design, code review |
| Frontend Engineer | `frontend-engineer` | UI implementation, React, components |
| Backend Engineer | `backend-engineer` | API implementation, services, data |
| QA Engineer | `qa-engineer` | Tests, verification, quality |

### Chaining Agents

For pipelines like `Architect → Dev → QA`:

1. Spawn first agent, wait for completion
2. Pass output as context to next agent
3. Continue chain until QA passes or max retries

### Reactive Loop

When QA finds errors:
1. Parse error type (test failure, design flaw, spec gap)
2. Route to appropriate agent based on error
3. Re-run QA after fix
4. Loop until success (max 3 retries)

### Example: Startup Frontend Flow

```
# Step 1: Spawn frontend-engineer
Task(
  subagent_type: "frontend-engineer",
  prompt: "Implement: <task>\n\nContext: Startup mode, fast iteration."
)

# Step 2: On completion, spawn qa-engineer
Task(
  subagent_type: "qa-engineer",
  prompt: "Verify implementation:\n<what was built>\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n<criteria>"
)

# Step 3: If QA fails, loop back to frontend-engineer with error context
Task(
  subagent_type: "frontend-engineer",
  prompt: "Fix this error:\n<error details>\n\nOriginal task: <task>"
)
```
