## STEP 2: IMMEDIATELY spawn learning-agent

**BEFORE asking user anything, detect the stack:**

```
Task(
  subagent_type: "learning-agent",
  prompt: "Detect stack and generate skills for this project. Output detected libraries."
)
```

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Use Explore agent
- ❌ Read files directly
- ❌ Ask user before learning

**WAIT for learning-agent to complete.**

## STEP 3: Ask User (with stack context)

After learning-agent returns detected stack, ask:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "Stack detected: [STACK]. What do you want to craft?",
    "header": "Craft",
    "multiSelect": false,
    "options": [
      { "label": "New feature", "description": "Build something new" },
      { "label": "Refactor", "description": "Improve existing code" },
      { "label": "Fix bug", "description": "Fix with tests" },
      { "label": "Add tests", "description": "E2E or unit coverage" }
    ]
  }]
}
```

### If "Refactor" selected, ask:

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "What to improve?",
    "header": "Refactor",
    "multiSelect": false,
    "options": [
      { "label": "Remove any types", "description": "Strict TypeScript" },
      { "label": "Result<T,E> pattern", "description": "Replace throw/catch" },
      { "label": "Hexagonal", "description": "Isolate domain" },
      { "label": "Add tests", "description": "BDD coverage" }
    ]
  }]
}
```

## STEP 4: Handle Response

### If ANTI-CRAFT detected (via "Other" free text)

**Keywords to detect:**
- "shit", "crap", "garbage", "dirty", "quick and dirty"
- "no tests", "skip tests", "without tests"
- "any types", "no types", "just JS", "basic JS"
- "just make it work", "don't care about quality"
- "spaghetti", "copy paste", "code smell"

**Response:**
```
🚫 CRAFT MODE — REQUEST DECLINED

I detected an anti-CRAFT intent in your request.

Within /craft, I only produce:
  ✓ Clean, well-architected code
  ✓ Proper error handling (Result<T,E>)
  ✓ Comprehensive tests (BDD)
  ✓ Strict TypeScript (no any)
  ✓ Domain-driven design

If you need low-quality code, exit /craft and ask outside this mode.
Would you like to rephrase with quality in mind?
```

Then use AskUserQuestion again with the same options.

### If VALID request

**AFTER learning-agent completes**, continue to STEP 5 (QA Config).

```

**IF USER SKIPPED OR YOU FORGOT: STOP AND ASK NOW.**

}
```

**If "Request changes" → PO creates spec-v(N+1).md → Ask approval again**

---

## STEP 7: Route to Agents

**Now route based on user choice:**

|--------|------|
| **New feature** | Ask for spec → PO → **USER APPROVAL** → Architect → Dev + QA |
| **Refactor** | Architect (refacto plan) → Dev → QA (regression) |

## AGENT ROUTING

**learning-agent already ran in STEP 2. Now route based on user choice:**

| User Choice | Agents (in order) |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **New feature** | product-owner → architect → dev(s) → qa |
| **Refactor** | architect → dev(s) → qa (regression) |
| **Fix bug** | architect → dev → qa |
| **Add tests** | qa (E2E) or dev (unit) |

**RULES:**
- NEVER use Explore agent
- NEVER write code directly — spawn dev agents
- NEVER skip the agent chain
- **ALWAYS spawn Dev + QA in PARALLEL** (same message, multiple Task calls)

---

## PARALLEL EXECUTION — MAXIMIZE THROUGHPUT

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                                                                   ║
║   🚀 PARALLELIZATION = SPEED                                     ║
║                                                                   ║
║   Multiple Task() calls in ONE message = PARALLEL execution      ║
║   Spawn as many agents as independent tasks allow                ║
║                                                                   ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### Rule 1: Dev + QA Always Parallel

```
// CORRECT — Dev and QA in parallel
Task(subagent_type: "frontend-engineer", prompt: "Implement...")
Task(subagent_type: "qa-engineer", prompt: "Write E2E tests...")
// Both in SAME message = parallel
```

### Rule 2: Multiple Dev Agents for Independent Tasks

**If tasks don't touch the same files, spawn multiple dev agents:**

```
// CORRECT — 3 independent tasks = 3 parallel agents
Task(subagent_type: "frontend-engineer", prompt: "Create Result type in src/types/")
Task(subagent_type: "frontend-engineer", prompt: "Add error boundaries in src/pages/")
Task(subagent_type: "frontend-engineer", prompt: "Refactor hooks in src/hooks/")
// All in SAME message = 3 agents working simultaneously
```

### Rule 3: Sequential When Dependencies Exist

```
// WRONG — These conflict (same file)
Task(frontend-engineer, "Add feature X to src/App.tsx")
Task(frontend-engineer, "Add feature Y to src/App.tsx")
// CONFLICT! Same file = must be sequential

// WRONG — Task B needs Task A's output
Task(frontend-engineer, "Create Result type")
Task(frontend-engineer, "Use Result type in services")
// DEPENDENCY! B needs A = must be sequential
```

### Parallelization Decision Matrix

| Situation | Approach | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Different files | ✅ PARALLEL | hooks/ + pages/ + types/ |
| Same file | ❌ SEQUENTIAL | Both modify App.tsx |
| Task B needs A's output | ❌ SEQUENTIAL | Create type → Use type |
| Dev + QA | ✅ PARALLEL | Implementation + E2E tests |
| Multiple features | ✅ PARALLEL | Feature A + Feature B (if independent) |

### Optimal Parallelization Strategy

```
ARCHITECT produces design with N tasks
│
├─ Group tasks by file/folder
│   ├─ Group A: src/types/* (1 agent)
│   ├─ Group B: src/hooks/* (1 agent)
│   ├─ Group C: src/pages/* (1 agent)
│   └─ Group D: src/components/* (1 agent)
│
├─ Identify dependencies
│   └─ Group B needs Group A? → Sequential
│
├─ Spawn independent groups in PARALLEL
│   Task(frontend-engineer, "Group A tasks...")
│   Task(frontend-engineer, "Group C tasks...")
│   Task(frontend-engineer, "Group D tasks...")
│   Task(qa-engineer, "Write tests...")
│
└─ Then spawn dependent groups
    Task(frontend-engineer, "Group B tasks (needs A)...")
```

### Max Parallel Agents

- **Recommended:** 3-5 dev agents + 1 QA agent
- **Why limit?** Too many agents = context fragmentation
- **Sweet spot:** Group related files into logical units

### frontend-engineer — Presentation & User Interaction

| Responsibility | Any Stack |
|----------------|-----------|
| UI rendering | Components, views, templates, canvas, WebGL, TUI |
| User input | Forms, events, gestures, keyboard, CLI prompts |
| Client-side state | UI state, caches, local storage |
| Display formatting | Dates, numbers, i18n for display |
| Animation/Graphics | Rendering, shaders, visual effects |

### backend-engineer — Data & Business Logic

| Responsibility | Any Stack |
|----------------|-----------|
| API endpoints | REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket handlers |
| Data persistence | Database, file system, storage |
| Business rules | Domain services, calculations, validations |
| External systems | Third-party APIs, queues, workers |
| Infrastructure | Deployment, configs, networking |

### Decision Process (Works for ANY Stack)

```
ASK: "What is this code's PRIMARY responsibility?"

PRESENTATION / USER INTERACTION  →  frontend-engineer
├─ Displays something to user (UI, CLI, graphics)
├─ Handles user input (events, forms, commands)
└─ Manages UI/display state

DATA / LOGIC / PERSISTENCE       →  backend-engineer
├─ Processes business rules
├─ Reads/writes data (DB, files, network)
└─ Communicates with external systems

WHEN IN DOUBT:
→ "If this was a human team, who would own this code?"
→ UI/UX dev → frontend-engineer
→ Data/API dev → backend-engineer
```

### Examples (Multi-Stack)

```
Task: "Create UI component for displaying items"
  → UI rendering = frontend-engineer ✅ (any framework)

Task: "Add database query for user lookup"
  → Data persistence = backend-engineer ✅ (any DB)

Task: "Build WASM module for image processing"
  → What does it do? Display to user? → frontend
  → What does it do? Process server-side? → backend

Task: "Implement CLI interface"
  → User interaction = frontend-engineer ✅

Task: "Add gRPC service handler"
  → API endpoint = backend-engineer ✅
```

**BE SMART. Analyze the code's RESPONSIBILITY, not the tech stack.**

### New Feature
```
1. learning-agent (stack detection) — AUTOMATIC

2. Ask: "What do you want to craft?" → New feature

3. Ask: "Do you have a spec?"
   - YES → Read it, pass to PO for review
   - NO → PO creates spec from description

4. User APPROVES spec (BLOCKING)

5. Ask: "Do you want QA tests?" → Yes/No (BLOCKING)
   - If Yes → "E2E or Integration?" + "Where?"

6. Spawn architect (design.md)

7. **PARALLEL: Spawn dev + QA in SAME message:**
   ```
   Task(subagent_type: "frontend-engineer", prompt: "Implement from design...")
   Task(subagent_type: "qa-engineer", prompt: "Write E2E tests from spec...")
   ```

8. Fixing loop until all green
```

### Refactor (Improve Existing)
```
1. learning-agent (stack detection) — AUTOMATIC

2. Ask: "What do you want to craft?" → Refactor

3. Ask: "What to improve?"
   - Remove any types
   - Migrate to Result<T,E>
   - Restructure to hexagonal
   - Other (free text)

4. (No spec approval for refactors — no functional change)

5. Ask: "Do you want QA tests?" → Yes/No (BLOCKING)
   - If Yes → Regression tests recommended
   - "Where to store tests?"

6. Spawn architect (refactoring plan)

7. **PARALLEL: Spawn dev + QA in SAME message (if QA enabled):**
   ```
   Task(subagent_type: "frontend-engineer", prompt: "Implement refactoring...")
   Task(subagent_type: "qa-engineer", prompt: "Write regression tests...")
   ```

8. Fixing loop until all green
```

### Fix Bug
```
1. learning-agent (stack detection) — AUTOMATIC

2. Ask: "What do you want to craft?" → Fix bug

3. Ask: "Describe the bug"

4. (No spec approval for bug fixes)

5. Ask: "Do you want QA tests?" → Yes/No (BLOCKING)
   - If Yes → Test to verify fix recommended

6. Spawn architect (diagnose)

7. Spawn dev (fix)

8. Spawn QA (verify) — if enabled

9. Fixing loop until all green
```

### Add Tests Only
```
1. learning-agent (stack detection) — AUTOMATIC

2. Ask: "What do you want to craft?" → Add tests

3. Ask: "E2E or Unit tests?"
   - E2E → QA agent
   - Unit → Dev agent

4. (No spec approval, no QA config — this IS the QA)

5. Spawn appropriate agent

6. Fixing loop until all green
```

## TASK MANAGEMENT — TRACK PROGRESS

**For complex refactors with multiple tasks, use TaskCreate to track:**

```
// After Architect produces plan with N tasks:
TaskCreate({ subject: "Create Result type", description: "..." })
TaskCreate({ subject: "Refactor hooks", description: "...", blockedBy: ["1"] })
TaskCreate({ subject: "Add error boundaries", description: "..." })
TaskCreate({ subject: "Write regression tests", description: "..." })
```

**Benefits:**
- User sees progress in real-time
- Dependencies tracked automatically
- Easy to resume if interrupted

**Update tasks as agents complete:**
```
TaskUpdate({ taskId: "1", status: "completed" })
```

npm run build && npm test && npx tsc --noEmit
```

### Step 2: If failures → Claude routes to right agent

| Error Type | Route To | Agent Fixes |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| Type error (TS) | frontend/backend-engineer | Fix types in src/ |
| Build error | frontend/backend-engineer | Fix compilation |
| Test failure in src/*.test.ts | frontend/backend-engineer | Fix test or impl |
| Test failure in e2e/ | qa-engineer | Fix E2E test |
| Design flaw | architect | Update design doc |

### Step 3: Agent fixes → Claude re-runs checks

```
Claude runs checks
    │
    ├─ Errors? → Spawn agent with error context
    │              Agent fixes
    │              Agent completes
    │
    └─ Claude runs checks AGAIN
         │
         ├─ Still errors? → Loop (max 3 retries)
         └─ All green? → DONE
```

### Step 4: Loop until green or max retries

**NEVER ask user during fixing loop. Agents fix autonomously.**

**If max retries reached → suggest `/heal` to user.**

## ERROR ROUTING IN FIXING LOOP

| Error Type | Route To | Action |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Build error in src/ | Dev agent | Fix compilation |
| Test failure in *.test.ts | Dev agent | Fix test or implementation |
| Test failure in e2e/ | QA agent | Fix E2E test |
| Type error | Architect | May need design change |
| Lint error | Dev agent | Quick fix |
| Missing dependency | Dev agent | npm install |

**Fixing loop spawns the RIGHT agent for EACH error type.**

### Quick Reference: Questions to Ask

| Flow | Steps BEFORE Architect |
|------|------------------------|
| **New feature** | "Do you have a spec?" → PO → **USER APPROVES SPEC** → "Do you want QA?" |
| **Refactor** | "What to improve?" → "Do you want QA?" |
| **Fix bug** | "Describe the bug" → "Do you want QA?" |
| **Add tests** | "E2E or Unit?" (no approval, no QA question) |

### Critical Checkpoints

```
NEW FEATURE:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  1. Spec created/transformed by PO                  │
  │  2. USER APPROVES SPEC ← MANDATORY CHECKPOINT      │
  │  3. QA config asked ← MANDATORY                    │
  │  4. THEN spawn Architect                            │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

REFACTOR / BUG FIX:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  1. Details gathered (what to improve / bug desc)   │
  │  2. QA config asked ← MANDATORY                    │
  │  3. THEN spawn Architect                            │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## POST-ARCHITECT: PARSE & PARALLELIZE

**After Architect returns design, BEFORE spawning dev agents:**

```
1. READ the design.md / refactoring plan
2. EXTRACT individual tasks
3. GROUP by file/folder (parallelization units)
4. IDENTIFY dependencies between groups
5. CREATE TaskCreate entries for tracking
6. SPAWN independent groups in PARALLEL
7. SPAWN dependent groups AFTER their dependencies complete
```

### Example: Architect Returns 8 Tasks

```
Architect plan:
  1. Create Result<T,E> type         → src/types/
  2. Create error types              → src/types/
  3. Refactor useAuth hook           → src/hooks/ (needs 1)
  4. Refactor useData hook           → src/hooks/ (needs 1)
  5. Add ErrorBoundary               → src/components/
  6. Update App.tsx                  → src/ (needs 5)
  7. Colocate tests                  → multiple folders
  8. Write regression tests          → e2e/

Grouping:
  Group A (independent): Tasks 1, 2 → src/types/
  Group B (needs A): Tasks 3, 4 → src/hooks/
  Group C (independent): Task 5 → src/components/
  Group D (needs C): Task 6 → src/
  Group E (independent): Task 7 → multiple
  Group F (independent): Task 8 → e2e/ (QA)

Execution:
  WAVE 1 (parallel):
    Task(frontend-engineer, "Tasks 1, 2: Create Result and error types")
    Task(frontend-engineer, "Task 5: Add ErrorBoundary")
    Task(frontend-engineer, "Task 7: Colocate tests")
    Task(qa-engineer, "Task 8: Write regression tests")

  WAVE 2 (after Wave 1):
    Task(frontend-engineer, "Tasks 3, 4: Refactor hooks with Result")
    Task(frontend-engineer, "Task 6: Update App.tsx with ErrorBoundary")
```

### Summary Display for User

After parsing architect's plan, show:

```
📋 EXECUTION PLAN

Wave 1 (parallel):
  • frontend-engineer: Create Result types (src/types/)
  • frontend-engineer: Add ErrorBoundary (src/components/)
  • frontend-engineer: Colocate tests (multiple)
  • qa-engineer: Write regression tests (e2e/)

Wave 2 (after Wave 1):
