<h1 align="center">Stop prompting. Start crafting.</h1>

  <em>Turn Claude Code into a team of expert developers<br/>that write production-ready code. Together.</em>
</p>

## The Problem

You prompt. AI dumps code. You debug it.

No architecture. No tests. No standards. Just... code.

**You became the QA for an AI.**

---

## The Solution

What if Claude Code worked like a **real dev team**?

```
You: "Build user authentication"

    Product Owner    →  Writes the spec
    Architect        →  Designs the solution
    Developer        →  Implements it
    QA Engineer      →  Tests it

    Bug found? → Dev fixes → QA re-tests → Loop until green.
```

That's Spectre.

---

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fredericvilcot/spectre-agents/main/install.sh | bash
```

---

## Three Commands. That's It.

```bash
/craft    # Build something
/heal     # Fix something
/learn    # Adapt to your codebase
```

---

## `/craft` — Your AI Dev Team

Say what you want. Spectre assembles the right team.

```
> /craft "a beautiful counter with animations"

👤 PO: Writing spec...
   ✓ User story defined
   ✓ 6 acceptance criteria

🏗️ Architect: Designing...
   ✓ Clean architecture
   ✓ File structure ready

💻 Dev + 🧪 QA: Building...
   ✓ Counter.tsx created
   ✓ Tests written
   ✗ Test failed: animation not smooth
   🔧 Dev fixing...
   ✓ All tests passing

✨ Done. 8 files. 12 tests. Production-ready.
```

**No spec? PO writes it.**
**No design? Architect creates it.**
**Bug? Dev fixes it. Automatically.**

---

## `/heal` — Smart Auto-Repair

Something broken? Spectre knows who to call.

```bash
/heal        # Fix everything
/heal tests  # Just the tests
/heal types  # Just TypeScript errors
```

| Problem | Spectre routes to |
|---------|-------------------|
| Test failing | Developer |
| Type error | Architect |
| Missing edge case | Product Owner |

---

## `/learn` — Adapts to YOU

Spectre learns your codebase:

- Your folder structure
- Your naming conventions
- Your patterns

Then enforces them. Everywhere.

```
> /learn

📦 Detected: TypeScript + React + Vitest
📐 Patterns: Feature folders, Result types
⚠️ Found: 5x 'any' types

🏗️ Architect proposes refactoring plan...
```

---

## Why Spectre?

| Without Spectre | With Spectre |
|-----------------|--------------|
| You prompt, you debug | Agents collaborate, QA verifies |
| Generic code | Learns YOUR patterns |
| `any` everywhere | Strict TypeScript |
| `throw new Error` | `Result<T, E>` |
| No tests | Tests included |
| You are the QA | QA agent catches bugs |

---

## The Team

| Agent | Superpower |
|-------|------------|
| **Product Owner** | Turns vague ideas into clear specs |
| **Architect** | Designs clean, maintainable solutions |
| **Developer** | Implements with craft principles |
| **QA Engineer** | Catches bugs before you do |
| **Learning Agent** | Adapts everything to YOUR codebase |

---

## Craft Principles

Every agent follows:

- **No `any`** — Types are documentation
- **No `throw`** — Use `Result<T, E>`
- **No god classes** — Single responsibility
- **No code without tests** — TDD mindset
- **No implementation without spec** — Contracts first
