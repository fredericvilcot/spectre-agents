## The Idea

You've used AI coding tools. You know the drill:

*"Build me a login form"* → 200 lines of spaghetti → *"It doesn't work"* → 200 more lines → *"Now there are 2 bugs"* → You delete everything and write it yourself.

**What if AI worked like a real engineering team instead?**

With Spectre, when you ask for a login form:
- The **Architect** designs the auth flow with proper security patterns
- The **Developer** implements it with type-safe code and explicit error handling
- The **QA Engineer** tests it, finds edge cases, catches bugs
- When tests fail, the Developer fixes them automatically
- You get production-ready code. Tested. Architected. Clean.

That's the difference between *prompting* and *crafting*.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fvilcot/spectre-agents/main/install.sh | bash
```

Restart Claude Code. You're ready.

## Craft

> `/craft` — Build features with the right team for your context.

```
> /craft

What's your work context?

  🏢 Product Team   →  Full workflow with specs and reviews
  🚀 Startup        →  Fast iterations, still architected
  💼 Freelance      →  Direct and efficient
  📚 Learning       →  One agent explains step by step
```

**Starting from scratch?** Spectre guides you through stack selection:

```
> /craft

No project detected. What stack?

  ⚡ TypeScript + React    →  Vite, Vitest, TailwindCSS
  🟢 TypeScript + Node     →  Express/Fastify, Zod
  🐹 Go                    →  Standard lib or Gin/Echo
  🦀 Rust                  →  Cargo, async runtime
  🐍 Python                →  FastAPI/Django

> TypeScript + React

Setting up with craft defaults...
  ✓ Strict TypeScript
  ✓ Vitest + Testing Library
  ✓ ESLint + Prettier
  ✓ Path aliases configured

Ready. What do you want to build?
```

Describe what you need. Spectre assembles the team:

```
> "User authentication with OAuth and magic links"

Assembling: Architect → Frontend Engineer → QA Engineer

🏗️ Architect designing auth flow...
   ✓ OAuth2 + PKCE for security
   ✓ Magic link with short-lived tokens
   ✓ Session management strategy

💻 Frontend Engineer implementing...
   ✓ Type-safe auth context
   ✓ Protected route wrapper
   ✓ Login/callback components

🧪 QA Engineer testing...
   ✓ 12 tests passing
   ✓ Edge cases covered
   ✓ Security scenarios verified

✅ Ready to ship.
```

The workflow adapts to your context. Product teams get full specs and reviews. Startups get fast iterations. Freelancers get straight to the point. Learners get explanations.

---

## Heal

> `/heal` — Auto-fix everything. Tests, types, build, specs.

```bash
/heal           # Diagnose and fix whatever is broken
/heal tests     # Fix failing tests
/heal types     # Fix TypeScript errors
/heal spec      # Sync spec with implementation
```

Spectre doesn't just throw code at problems. It routes each issue to the right expert:

```
> /heal

🔍 Diagnosing...
   ❌ 3 tests failing
   ❌ 2 type errors

🏗️ Architect fixing type errors...
   → Missing branded type at API boundary
   ✓ Fixed

💻 Frontend Engineer fixing tests...
   → Error state not announced to screen readers
   ✓ Fixed

🧪 QA verifying...
   ✓ All passing

✅ Healed.
```

Test failures go to the dev who wrote the code. Type errors go to the Architect. Spec gaps go to the Product Owner. The right expert, every time.

---

## Learn

> **Active by default.** Spectre auto-detects your stack and learns your patterns.

You don't need to run `/learn` — it happens automatically when you use `/craft` or `/heal`.

```bash
/learn                  # Re-learn entire project (refresh)
/learn --only <path>    # Learn ONLY from this file/folder
/learn --off            # Disable auto-learning
/learn --on             # Re-enable (default)
/learn --show           # Show current learnings
```

**Works with any stack.** TypeScript, Go, Rust, Python, Java — Spectre detects it and adapts.

**But it won't learn garbage.**

```
> /craft "Add user service"

🔍 Auto-detecting stack... Node.js + TypeScript + React
🔍 Learning patterns...

🛑 CRAFT VIOLATIONS DETECTED

   src/services/UserService.ts:45
   → throw new Error('User not found')
   → Violates: Explicit Error Handling
   → Fix: Return Result<User, NotFoundError>

📋 Report: .spectre/violations-report.md

❌ Pattern NOT learned. Fix violation first.
```

The guard is always on. Every stack. No exceptions.

## The Team

Six specialists. Each with deep expertise. Working together.

**👤 Product Owner** — Transforms vague ideas into clear specs. User stories with acceptance criteria. Edge cases you forgot to think about.

**🏗️ Architect** — Designs systems that scale. Clean Architecture. Domain-Driven Design. SOLID principles. Code review with teeth.

**💻 Frontend Engineer** — Builds interfaces users love. Accessible. Performant. Type-safe. Components that compose well.

**⚙️ Backend Engineer** — APIs that are secure and fast. Explicit error handling. Proper validation. No `any`, no shortcuts.

**🧪 QA Engineer** — Tests that prove it works. TDD/BDD. Meaningful coverage. Catches bugs before you do.

**🎭 Orchestrator** — Coordinates the team. Routes problems to the right expert. Manages retries. Keeps the loop flowing.

## Reactive Links

Agents don't just work in sequence. They react to each other.

When QA finds a test failure → Dev fixes it → QA re-verifies.
When QA finds a design flaw → Architect redesigns → Dev updates → QA re-verifies.
When Dev is blocked by design → Architect adjusts → Dev continues.
When Architect finds a spec contradiction → Product Owner arbitrates.

Every problem goes to the expert who can solve it. Automatically.

## Philosophy

**Domain First** — Business logic lives at the center. Frameworks live at the edges. Your domain model is sacred.

**Type Safety** — Types are documentation that compiles. No `any`. No escape hatches. The compiler is your ally.

**Explicit Over Implicit** — No magic. No surprises. `Result<T, E>` over thrown exceptions. Make the code tell its story.

**Test-Driven** — Tests are specifications that run. Write the test first. Let it drive the design.

**Self-Correcting** — Agents catch their own mistakes. QA fails, Dev fixes, QA verifies. Humans step in only when needed.

**Adaptive** — Learns your patterns. Guards your standards. Refuses to learn anti-patterns.
