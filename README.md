## Why Spectre is Different

| Other Agent Libs | Spectre |
|------------------|---------|
| Agents do tasks | Agents **enforce standards** |
| You fix the bugs | Agents **fix their own bugs** |
| Generic output | **Learns YOUR patterns** |
| No architecture | **Clean Architecture, DDD, Hexagonal** |
| `any`, `throw`, chaos | **Strict types, Result<T,E>, order** |

**Spectre isn't a tool. It's a philosophy.**

---

## The Problem

You prompt. AI dumps code. You debug it.

No architecture. No tests. No standards. Just... code.

**You became the QA for an AI.**

---

## The Solution

What if Claude Code worked like a **real dev team**?

```
You: "Build user authentication"

    Product Owner    →  Writes the spec
    Architect        →  Designs the solution
    Developer        →  Implements it
    QA Engineer      →  Tests it

    Bug found? → Dev fixes → QA re-tests → Loop until green.
```

That's Spectre.

---

## Prerequisites

**Claude Code CLI** must be installed first:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Or via Homebrew
brew install claude-code
```

> 📖 [Claude Code Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude-code)

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fredericvilcot/spectre-agents/main/install.sh | bash
```

Spectre is built on **Software Craft** principles — the philosophy that code is a craft, not just a task.

> *"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."* — Martin Fowler

> *"The only way to go fast is to go well."* — Robert C. Martin

### The Masters Behind the Craft

Every Spectre agent embodies the teachings of:

- **Kent Beck** — TDD, XP, "Make it work, make it right, make it fast"
- **Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)** — Clean Code, SOLID, Clean Architecture
- **Martin Fowler** — Refactoring, Enterprise Patterns
- **Eric Evans** — Domain-Driven Design
- **Alistair Cockburn** — Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)

### Architecture: Domain at the Center

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              INFRASTRUCTURE                  │
│   (HTTP, DB, External APIs — replaceable)   │
│  ┌───────────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │            APPLICATION                 │  │
│  │         (Use Cases, Ports)            │  │
│  │  ┌─────────────────────────────────┐  │  │
│  │  │            DOMAIN               │  │  │
│  │  │   (Entities, Value Objects)     │  │  │
│  │  │        Pure. No deps.           │  │  │
│  │  └─────────────────────────────────┘  │  │
│  └───────────────────────────────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         Dependencies point INWARD →
```

### Craft Principles — Non-Negotiable

| Principle | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| **No `any`** | Types are documentation. `any` is lying. |
| **No `throw`** | Use `Result<T, E>`. Errors are values, not surprises. |
| **No god classes** | Single responsibility. Small, focused units. |
| **No code without tests** | TDD mindset. Tests are specs that run. |
| **No implementation without spec** | Contracts first. PO spec → Architect design → Dev implements. |
| **Domain is sacred** | No framework contamination. Pure business logic. |

### Error Handling: Explicit, Not Exceptional

```typescript
// BAD — Caller doesn't know this can fail
function getUser(id: string): User {
  throw new Error('Not found');
}

// GOOD — Error is explicit in the type
function getUser(id: string): Result<User, NotFoundError> {
  return err(new NotFoundError(id));
}
```

**Spectre agents write code where errors are values, not surprises.**

## ⚡ Reactive — Agents Talk to Each Other

**Errors don't stop the flow. They route it.**

```
Test fails     → Dev fixes automatically
Type error     → Architect redesigns
Spec unclear   → PO clarifies
```

No manual intervention. The right agent handles it.

## 🧠 Adaptive — Real-Time CRAFT Guardian

<table>
<tr>
<td width="300">

**Always watching. Always learning.**

The Learning Agent monitors your code **in real-time**:

- 👁️ Watches every code change
- 🔴 Detects CRAFT violations instantly
- 🏗️ Triggers Architect immediately
- 💬 Prompts you for approval

**Auto-learning is ON by default.**

⚠️ CRAFT VIOLATION DETECTED

File: src/api/client.ts:45
Issue: `any` type found

🏗️ Architect suggests:
Replace `data: any` with `ApiResponse<T>`

```

### What Gets Watched

| 🔴 Critical | 🟠 Warning | 🟡 Smells |
|-------------|------------|-----------|
| `any` types | God class (>300 lines) | Feature Envy |
| `throw` in domain | Long methods (>20 lines) | Data Clumps |
| Framework in domain | Long params (>4) | Primitive Obsession |
| No tests for business | Poor naming | Shotgun Surgery |
| Dependency Rule violation | Missing strict mode | |
| Hidden coupling | | |

**+ All SOLID principles monitored.**

## Three Commands. That's It.

```bash
/craft    # Build something
/heal     # Fix something
/learn    # Adapt to your codebase
```

---

## `/craft` — Your AI Dev Team

Say what you want. Spectre does the rest.

```
> /craft "user authentication with OAuth"

🔍 Detected: TypeScript + React + Node

👤 PO → spec.md
   ✓ User story
   ✓ 6 acceptance criteria

🏗️ Architect → design.md
   ✓ 8 files planned
   ✓ CRAFT patterns

💻 Dev + 🧪 QA (parallel)
   ✓ Implementing...
   ✗ Test failed: OAuth callback
   🔧 Dev fixing... (auto)
   ✓ 6/6 tests passing

✨ Done.
```

**All agents. Always. No shortcuts. Autonomous fixing.**

---

## `/heal` — Re-launch the Agent Loop

Something broken? Spectre relaunches agents to fix it.

```bash
/heal        # Diagnose → Route → Fix → Verify → Loop
/heal tests  # Focus on test failures
/heal types  # Focus on TypeScript errors
```

**`/heal` is NOT `npm test`.** It relaunches the full agent loop:

1. **Diagnose** — What's broken?
2. **Route** — Send to the right agent
3. **Fix** — Agent fixes autonomously
4. **Verify** — QA re-runs tests
5. **Loop** — Until all green

| Problem | Agent fixes it |
|---------|----------------|
| Test failing | Developer |
| Type error | Architect |
| Spec gap | Product Owner |

---

## `/learn` — Real-Time Guardian

**Auto-learning is ON by default.** The Learning Agent watches your code continuously.

```bash
/learn              # Force re-scan now
/learn --off        # Disable auto-learning (not recommended)
/learn --from <x>   # Learn from external source (repo, folder, URL)
```

When violations are detected:

```
⚠️ CRAFT violation in src/services/auth.ts

🏗️ Architect proposes fix:
   Replace `throw new Error` with `Result<User, AuthError>`

[ 💜 Approve & Fix ]  [ ⏭️ Later ]
```

**Violation → Architect → User approval → Dev fixes → QA verifies**

---

## Why Spectre?

| Without Spectre | With Spectre |
|-----------------|--------------|
| You prompt, you debug | Agents collaborate, QA verifies |
| Generic code | Learns YOUR patterns |
| `any` everywhere | Strict TypeScript |
| `throw new Error` | `Result<T, E>` |
| No tests | Tests included |
| You are the QA | QA agent catches bugs |

---

## The Team

| Agent | Superpower |
|-------|------------|
| **Product Owner** | Turns vague ideas into clear specs |
| **Architect** | Designs clean, maintainable solutions |
| **Developer** | Implements with craft principles |
| **QA Engineer** | Catches bugs before you do |
| **Learning Agent** | Adapts everything to YOUR codebase |
