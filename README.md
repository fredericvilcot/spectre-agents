## Philosophy

> Code is a craft. We favor quality, readability, and maintainability over speed.

Every component is built on these principles:

1. **Domain First** — Business logic at the center, frameworks at the periphery
2. **Type Safety** — The type system as safety net and living documentation
3. **Explicit over Implicit** — Explicit error handling, no silent exceptions
4. **Test-Driven** — Tests as executable specifications
5. **Pedagogy** — Explain the "why" before the "how"
