║   2. DEV ROUTING = ANALYZE WHAT THE CODE DOES                             ║
║      → UI, rendering, user interaction? → frontend-engineer              ║

║   3. PO ROUTING = SMART (not all tasks need specs)                       ║
║      → New feature, user-facing bug → PO writes spec (approval required) ║
║      → Refactor, migration, technical bug → SKIP PO → Architect directly ║
║      → Tests only → SKIP PO + Architect → QA directly                   ║

║      → BEFORE spawning Architect: "Do you want QA tests?"                ║
║      → This question MUST be asked for New feature, Refactor, Fix bug    ║
║      → If you forgot → STOP and ask NOW                                  ║

║   6. PARALLEL EXECUTION = MULTIPLE TASK() IN ONE MESSAGE                  ║
║      → Dev + QA in parallel (same message)                               ║

## Three Commands

```bash
/craft    # Smart flow: learn stack → contextual choices → build
/heal     # Auto-fix: route problems to right agent
/learn    # Re-generate library skills if stack evolved
```

## `/craft` — Learn First, Smart Choices

**Stack detection first. Then intelligent options based on what's detected.**

### Free Text = Smart Routing

Type anything, get routed to the right CRAFT flow:

| You say | Clean Claude does |
|---------|--------------|
| "Create e2e regression tests" | QA Agent (regression mode) |
| "Check my Tailwind is clean" | Architect Audit |
| "Add dark mode" | Full flow: PO → Arch → Dev → QA |
| "Migrate to fp-ts" | Architect refactoring plan |
| "Just write unit tests" | Dev only (BDD tests) |

**Always respects CRAFT principles.**

### QA Config (Upfront)

```
Want QA tests?
├─ ✅ Yes → E2E or Integration?
│           └─ Where? (e2e/ | custom path | different repo)
└─ ⏭️ No → Dev only (unit tests)
```

If QA enabled: **Dev + QA run in parallel.**

---

## `/learn` — Stack & Architecture Learning

```bash
/learn                      # Learn everything (stack + architecture)
/learn stack                # Stack only (libraries)
/learn architecture         # Architecture only (project patterns)
/learn <url|path>           # Analyze external source (GitHub URL or folder)
```

### What It Learns

| Mode | What | Output |
|------|------|--------|
| **stack** | Installed libraries | `.clean-claude/stack-skills.md` |
| **architecture** | Project patterns (CRAFT-validated) | `.clean-claude/architecture-guide.md` |
| **external** | External repo/folder analysis | `.clean-claude/external-analysis.md` |

### CRAFT Validation (Critical)

║   • `throw` without Result? → REJECT                         ║
║   • No clear architecture? → WARN                            ║

```

### External Analysis

```bash
/learn https://github.com/org/repo    # Analyze GitHub repo
/learn ./other-project                # Analyze local folder
```

Generates a report:
- ✅ CRAFT-compliant: Lists patterns worth adopting
- ⚠️ NOT compliant: Lists violations, recommends alternatives

## Reactive Notification System (CORE)

**Agents notify each other. This is the heart of Clean Claude.**

## `/heal` — Trigger Notification Loop

```
/heal
  │
  ├─ Diagnose (build, tests, types, lint)
  ├─ NOTIFY owning agent (never fix directly!)
  │     QA → Dev: "🔴 Your code in src/cart.ts broke"
  │     Dev fixes → notifies QA: "✅ Fixed, re-test"
  ├─ Loop until ALL GREEN
```

```bash
/heal           # Full diagnostic
/heal tests     # Focus on test failures
/heal types     # Focus on TypeScript errors
```

## The Agents

| Agent | Role | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| **learning-agent** | Detects stack, spawns Architect for skills | `.clean-claude/context.json` |
| **architect** | Library skills + Technical design | `.clean-claude/stack-skills.md`, `design.md` |
| **product-owner** | Functional specs, user stories | `.clean-claude/specs/functional/` |
| **frontend-engineer** | UI + unit tests (BDD) | Code + `*.test.ts` |
| **backend-engineer** | API + unit tests (BDD) | Code + `*.test.ts` |
| **qa-engineer** | E2E or Integration tests | `e2e/` or custom path |

### frontend-engineer — Presentation & User Interaction

| Responsibility | Any Stack |
|----------------|-----------|
| UI rendering | Components, views, templates, canvas, WebGL |
| User input | Forms, events, gestures, keyboard |
| Client-side state | UI state, caches, local storage |
| Display formatting | Dates, numbers, i18n for display |

### backend-engineer — Data & Business Logic

| Responsibility | Any Stack |
|----------------|-----------|
| API endpoints | REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket handlers |
| Data persistence | Database, file system, storage |
| Business rules | Domain services, calculations, validations |
| External systems | Third-party APIs, queues, workers |

### Decision Process (Stack-Agnostic)

```
ASK: "What is this code's PRIMARY responsibility?"

PRESENTATION / USER INTERACTION  →  frontend-engineer
├─ Displays something to user
├─ Handles user input
└─ Manages UI state

DATA / LOGIC / PERSISTENCE       →  backend-engineer
├─ Processes business rules
├─ Reads/writes data
└─ Communicates with external systems

WHEN IN DOUBT:
→ "If this was a human team, who would own this?"
→ Designer/UI dev → frontend | Data/API dev → backend
```

---

## Software Craft Principles

Non-negotiable rules for ALL agents:

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **No `any`** | Strict TypeScript, types are documentation |
| **No `throw`** | `Result<T, E>` — errors are values |
| **Domain isolation** | Hexagonal: domain has ZERO framework imports |
| **Colocated tests** | `*.test.ts` next to source (BDD style) |
| **Spec before code** | PO spec → Architect design → Dev implements |

**Committed files = shared documentation:**
- `architecture-guide.md` — Reference architecture for all µApps
- `specs/` — Versioned functional and technical specs

## Auto Architecture Capture

**First feature → Reference architecture for all future features.**

```
/craft "Create authentication µApp"
  │
  ├─ Implementation complete
  │
  └─ "First feature complete. Capture as reference architecture?"
       │
       ├─ Yes → Generate .clean-claude/architecture-guide.md
       │        Future µApps MUST follow this structure
       │
       └─ No → Skip (architecture guide created later)
```

### Monolith Consistency

For monoliths with multiple µApps:
- **First µApp** → Captures the reference architecture
- **All other µApps** → MUST follow the same patterns
- Architect reads `architecture-guide.md` BEFORE designing new features

---

## Philosophy

- **Learn first** — Know the stack AND validate CRAFT compliance before acting
- **Never learn from smells** — Reject anti-patterns, suggest fixes
- **Architecture consistency** — First feature = reference for all µApps
- **Smart routing** — Free text → right agent
- **Craft-first** — Software Craft in every line
- **Autonomous** — Agents fix without asking
- **Parallel** — Dev + QA work simultaneously
