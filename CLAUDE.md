# CLAUDE.md

> **Stop prompting. Start crafting.**

Spectre transforms Claude Code into a team of Software Craft experts. Clean architecture, Result types, TDD, domain-driven. All agents collaborate reactively.

## Three Commands

```bash
/craft    # Smart flow: learn stack → contextual choices → build
/heal     # Auto-fix: route problems to right agent
/learn    # Re-generate library skills if stack evolved
```

---

## `/craft` — Learn First, Smart Choices

**Stack detection first. Then intelligent options based on what's detected.**

### Free Text = Smart Routing

Type anything, get routed to the right CRAFT flow:

| You say | Spectre does |
|---------|--------------|
| "Create e2e regression tests" | QA Agent (regression mode) |
| "Check my Tailwind is clean" | Architect Audit |
| "Add dark mode" | Full flow: PO → Arch → Dev → QA |
| "Migrate to fp-ts" | Architect refactoring plan |
| "Just write unit tests" | Dev only (BDD tests) |

**Always respects CRAFT principles.**

### QA Config (Upfront)

```
Want QA tests?
├─ ✅ Yes → E2E or Integration?
│           └─ Where? (e2e/ | custom path | different repo)
└─ ⏭️ No → Dev only (unit tests)
```

If QA enabled: **Dev + QA run in parallel.**

---

## `/learn` — Re-generate Library Skills

```bash
/learn    # Re-detect stack, regenerate skills
```

Use when stack evolved (added new library). Runs automatically at `/craft` start.

**What it does:**
1. Learning Agent reads `package.json`
2. Architect generates library documentation
3. Output: `.spectre/stack-skills.md`

**What it generates:**
- Library API and patterns (TypeScript, fp-ts, Zod, React...)
- NOT CRAFT patterns (Architect already knows those)
- NOT existing code patterns (might be garbage)

---

## `/heal` — Auto-Fix Loop

```
/heal
  │
  ├─ Diagnose (build, tests, types, lint)
  ├─ Route to right AGENT (never fix directly!)
  │     ├─ Build error → Dev Agent
  │     ├─ Test failing → Dev Agent
  │     ├─ Type error → Architect Agent
  │     ├─ Lint error → Dev Agent
  │     └─ Spec gap → PO Agent
  ├─ Agent fixes AUTONOMOUSLY
  └─ Loop until ALL GREEN
```

**CRITICAL: Claude NEVER fixes directly. Always spawns an agent.**

| Error | Agent |
|-------|-------|
| Build error | Dev |
| Test failure | Dev |
| Type error | Architect |
| Lint error | Dev |
| Design flaw | Architect |

```bash
/heal           # Full diagnostic
/heal tests     # Focus on test failures
/heal types     # Focus on TypeScript errors
```

---

## The Agents

| Agent | Role | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| **learning-agent** | Detects stack, spawns Architect for skills | `.spectre/context.json` |
| **architect** | Library skills + Technical design | `.spectre/stack-skills.md`, `design.md` |
| **product-owner** | Functional specs, user stories | `.spectre/specs/functional/` |
| **frontend-engineer** | UI + unit tests (BDD) | Code + `*.test.ts` |
| **backend-engineer** | API + unit tests (BDD) | Code + `*.test.ts` |
| **qa-engineer** | E2E or Integration tests | `e2e/` or custom path |

---

## Software Craft Principles

Non-negotiable rules for ALL agents:

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **No `any`** | Strict TypeScript, types are documentation |
| **No `throw`** | `Result<T, E>` — errors are values |
| **Domain isolation** | Hexagonal: domain has ZERO framework imports |
| **Colocated tests** | `*.test.ts` next to source (BDD style) |
| **Spec before code** | PO spec → Architect design → Dev implements |

**Specs are committed** — they're versioned documentation.

## Philosophy

- **Learn first** — Know the stack before asking questions
- **Smart routing** — Free text → right agent
- **Craft-first** — Software Craft in every line
- **Autonomous** — Agents fix without asking
- **Parallel** — Dev + QA work simultaneously
