  └─ QA config → PO → Architect → Dev + QA → Fixing loop
```

### Free Text = Smart Routing

Type anything, get routed to the right CRAFT flow:

| You say | Spectre does |
|---------|--------------|
| "Create e2e regression tests" | QA Agent (regression mode) |
| "Check my Tailwind is clean" | Architect Audit |
| "Add dark mode" | Full flow: PO → Arch → Dev → QA |
| "Migrate to fp-ts" | Architect refactoring plan |
| "Just write unit tests" | Dev only (BDD tests) |

**Always respects CRAFT principles.**

### QA Config (Upfront)

```
Want QA tests?
├─ ✅ Yes → E2E or Integration?
│           └─ Where? (e2e/ | custom path | different repo)
└─ ⏭️ No → Dev only (unit tests)
```

If QA enabled: **Dev + QA run in parallel.**

---

## `/learn` — Re-generate Library Skills

```bash
/learn    # Re-detect stack, regenerate skills
```

Use when stack evolved (added new library). Runs automatically at `/craft` start.

**What it does:**
1. Learning Agent reads `package.json`
2. Architect generates library documentation
3. Output: `.spectre/stack-skills.md`

**What it generates:**
- Library API and patterns (TypeScript, fp-ts, Zod, React...)
- NOT CRAFT patterns (Architect already knows those)
- NOT existing code patterns (might be garbage)

---

## Reactive Notification System (CORE)

**Agents notify each other. This is the heart of Spectre.**

```
┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐
│   DEV   │◄──►│   QA    │◄──►│  ARCH   │◄──►│   PO    │
└─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘
         NOTIFICATION BUS
```

| From | To | Example |
|------|-----|---------|
| QA | Dev | "🔴 Test failed: src/cart.ts:45 returns null" |
| Dev | QA | "✅ Fixed cart.ts, please re-test" |
| Dev | Architect | "❓ Type issue, need design clarification" |
| Architect | Dev | "📐 Design updated, re-implement checkout()" |
| QA | PO | "❓ Spec unclear: what happens on empty cart?" |

**RULE: You wrote it? You own it. You fix it.**

| Location | Owner |
|----------|-------|
| `src/**` | Dev |
| `e2e/**` | QA |
| `tests/**` | QA |
| `*.test.ts` (colocated) | Dev |
| Design | Architect |
| Spec | PO |

---

## `/heal` — Trigger Notification Loop

```
/heal
  │
  ├─ Diagnose (build, tests, types, lint)
  ├─ NOTIFY owning agent (never fix directly!)
  │     QA → Dev: "🔴 Your code in src/cart.ts broke"
  │     Dev fixes → notifies QA: "✅ Fixed, re-test"
  ├─ Loop until ALL GREEN
```

```bash
/heal           # Full diagnostic
/heal tests     # Focus on test failures
/heal types     # Focus on TypeScript errors
```

---

## The Agents

| Agent | Role | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| **learning-agent** | Detects stack, spawns Architect for skills | `.spectre/context.json` |
| **architect** | Library skills + Technical design | `.spectre/stack-skills.md`, `design.md` |
| **product-owner** | Functional specs, user stories | `.spectre/specs/functional/` |
| **frontend-engineer** | UI + unit tests (BDD) | Code + `*.test.ts` |
| **backend-engineer** | API + unit tests (BDD) | Code + `*.test.ts` |
| **qa-engineer** | E2E or Integration tests | `e2e/` or custom path |

### frontend-engineer — Presentation & User Interaction

| Responsibility | Any Stack |
|----------------|-----------|
| UI rendering | Components, views, templates, canvas, WebGL |
| User input | Forms, events, gestures, keyboard |
| Client-side state | UI state, caches, local storage |
| Display formatting | Dates, numbers, i18n for display |

### backend-engineer — Data & Business Logic

| Responsibility | Any Stack |
|----------------|-----------|
| API endpoints | REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket handlers |
| Data persistence | Database, file system, storage |
| Business rules | Domain services, calculations, validations |
| External systems | Third-party APIs, queues, workers |

### Decision Process (Stack-Agnostic)

```
ASK: "What is this code's PRIMARY responsibility?"

PRESENTATION / USER INTERACTION  →  frontend-engineer
├─ Displays something to user
├─ Handles user input
└─ Manages UI state

DATA / LOGIC / PERSISTENCE       →  backend-engineer
├─ Processes business rules
├─ Reads/writes data
└─ Communicates with external systems

WHEN IN DOUBT:
→ "If this was a human team, who would own this?"
→ Designer/UI dev → frontend | Data/API dev → backend
```

---

## Software Craft Principles

Non-negotiable rules for ALL agents:

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **No `any`** | Strict TypeScript, types are documentation |
| **No `throw`** | `Result<T, E>` — errors are values |
| **Domain isolation** | Hexagonal: domain has ZERO framework imports |
| **Colocated tests** | `*.test.ts` next to source (BDD style) |
| **Spec before code** | PO spec → Architect design → Dev implements |

## Philosophy

- **Learn first** — Know the stack before asking questions
- **Smart routing** — Free text → right agent
- **Craft-first** — Software Craft in every line
- **Autonomous** — Agents fix without asking
- **Parallel** — Dev + QA work simultaneously
