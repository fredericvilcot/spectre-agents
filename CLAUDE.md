║      → ONE file with frontmatter: `clean-claude: architecture-reference` ║

║   1c. STACK SKILLS = ARCHITECT'S JOB                                     ║
║      → Architect generates stack-skills.md WITH the design               ║
║      → No separate learning-agent needed                                 ║

║   2. DEV ROUTING = ANALYZE WHAT THE CODE DOES                             ║
║      → UI, rendering, user interaction? → frontend-engineer              ║
║      → Data, business logic, persistence, APIs? → backend-engineer       ║
║      → Ask: "What is this code's responsibility?"                        ║
║      → Works for ANY stack: React, Rust, Go, Python, WASM...            ║

║   3. PO ROUTING = SMART (not all tasks need specs)                       ║
║      → New feature, user-facing bug → PO writes spec (approval required) ║
║      → Refactor, migration, technical bug → SKIP PO → Architect directly ║
║      → Tests only → SKIP PO + Architect → QA directly                   ║
║      → PO = functional specs | Architect = technical design              ║
║                                                                           ║
║   4. QA QUESTION = BLOCKING (always Step 5)                               ║
║      → BEFORE spawning Architect: "Do you want QA tests?"                ║
║      → This question MUST be asked for New feature, Refactor, Fix bug    ║
║      → If you forgot → STOP and ask NOW                                  ║
║                                                                           ║
║   5. VERIFICATION = CLAUDE ORCHESTRATES                                   ║
║      → Claude runs the project's build/test commands                     ║
║      → Claude routes errors to appropriate agent                         ║
║      → Agent fixes → Claude re-runs → Loop until green                   ║

║   6. PARALLEL EXECUTION = MULTIPLE TASK() IN ONE MESSAGE                  ║
║      → Dev + QA in parallel (same message)                               ║
║      → Multiple dev agents for independent tasks                         ║
║      → Sequential only if same file or dependency                        ║
║                                                                           ║
║   7. GIT = DEVOPS AGENT (OBLIGATOIRE — NEVER CLAUDE DIRECTLY)            ║
║      → User says commit/push/PR/merge/tag/release/publish/deploy         ║
║      → Task(devops-engineer) IMMEDIATELY — no exceptions                 ║
║      → Claude NEVER runs git/gh commands in /craft or /heal              ║
║      → DevOps enforces conventional commits (feat:, fix:, etc.)          ║
║      → DevOps verifies tests green BEFORE committing                     ║
║      → Ship is ON-DEMAND, not automatic after verify                     ║
║                                                                           ║
║   8. DOUBLE APPROVAL FOR DANGEROUS OPERATIONS                             ║
║      → 🔴 Destructive: delete branch, force push, rollback prod,         ║
║        npm unpublish, destroy pipeline, git reset --hard                  ║
║      → 🟠 High-impact: deploy to prod, merge to main, npm publish,       ║
║        tag release, modify prod env vars                                  ║
║      → Claude asks AskUserQuestion BEFORE spawning DevOps                ║
║      → DevOps refuses if prompt lacks "USER CONFIRMED" flag               ║
║      → 🟢 Safe (no confirm): commit, push feature, PR, check CI          ║
║                                                                           ║

║   IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO SKIP ONE OF THESE → STOP AND FOLLOW IT             ║
║                                                                           ║

## Three Commands

```bash
/craft    # Smart flow: learn stack → contextual choices → build
/heal     # Auto-fix: route problems to right agent
/learn    # Re-generate library skills if stack evolved
```

## `/craft` — Learn First, Smart Choices

**Fast project detection. Skills generated later, just before dev.**

### Free Text = Smart Routing

Type anything, get routed to the right CRAFT flow:

| You say | Clean Claude does |
|---------|--------------|
| "Create e2e regression tests" | QA Agent (regression mode) |
| "Check my Tailwind is clean" | Architect Audit |
| "Add dark mode" | Full flow: PO → Arch → Dev → QA |
| "Migrate to fp-ts" | Architect refactoring plan |
| "Just write unit tests" | Dev only (BDD tests) |

**Always respects CRAFT principles.**

### QA Config (Upfront)

```
Dev ALWAYS writes unit tests (colocated *.test.ts) — not a choice.

In addition, want QA tests?
├─ ✅ Yes, E2E (Playwright) → QA agent in parallel with Dev
├─ ✅ Yes, Integration      → QA agent in parallel with Dev
└─ ⏭️ No, unit tests enough → Dev only
```

If QA enabled: **Dev + QA run in parallel (same Task() message).**

## `/learn` — Stack & Architecture Learning

```bash
/learn                      # Learn everything (stack + architecture)
/learn stack                # Stack only (libraries)
/learn architecture         # Architecture only (project patterns)
/learn <url|path>           # Analyze external source (GitHub URL or folder)
```

### What It Learns

| Mode | What | Output |
|------|------|--------|
| **stack** | Installed libraries | `specs/stack/stack-skills.md` |
| **architecture** | Project patterns (CRAFT-validated) | `.clean-claude/architecture-guide.md` |
| **external** | External repo/folder analysis | `.clean-claude/external-analysis.md` |

### CRAFT Validation (Critical)

### External Analysis

```bash
/learn https://github.com/org/repo    # Analyze GitHub repo
/learn ./other-project                # Analyze local folder
```

Generates a report:
- ✅ CRAFT-compliant: Lists patterns worth adopting
- ⚠️ NOT compliant: Lists violations, recommends alternatives

## Reactive Notification System (CORE)

**Agents notify each other. This is the heart of Clean Claude.**

```
┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐
│   DEV   │◄──►│   QA    │◄──►│  ARCH   │◄──►│   PO    │
└────┬────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘
     │              NOTIFICATION BUS
     │         ┌──────────┐
     └────────►│  DEVOPS  │◄── CI/CD failures routed back
               └──────────┘
```

| From | To | Example |
|------|-----|---------|
| QA | Dev | "🔴 Test failed: src/cart.ts:45 returns null" |
| Dev | QA | "✅ Fixed cart.ts, please re-test" |
| Dev | Architect | "❓ Type issue, need design clarification" |
| Architect | Dev | "📐 Design updated, re-implement checkout()" |
| QA | PO | "❓ Spec unclear: what happens on empty cart?" |
| DevOps | Dev | "🔴 CI failed: test X in pipeline Y" |
| DevOps | Architect | "🔴 CI failed: type error in pipeline Y" |
| DevOps | QA | "🔴 CI failed: E2E test X in pipeline Y" |
| Dev | DevOps | "✅ Fixed, re-run pipeline" |

**RULE: You wrote it? You own it. You fix it.**

| Location | Owner |
|----------|-------|
| `src/**` | Dev |
| `e2e/**` | QA |
| `tests/**` | QA |
| `*.test.ts` (colocated) | Dev |
| Design | Architect |
| Spec | PO |
| `.github/workflows/**` | DevOps |
| `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.*` | DevOps |
| `.npmrc`, `.changeset/**` | DevOps |
| CI/CD pipeline configs | DevOps |

## `/heal` — Trigger Notification Loop

```
/heal
  │
  ├─ Diagnose (build, tests, types, lint)
  ├─ NOTIFY owning agent (never fix directly!)
  │     QA → Dev: "🔴 Your code in src/cart.ts broke"
  │     Dev fixes → notifies QA: "✅ Fixed, re-test"
  ├─ Loop until ALL GREEN
```

```bash
/heal           # Full diagnostic
/heal tests     # Focus on test failures
/heal types     # Focus on TypeScript errors
```

---

## The Agents

| Agent | Role | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| **architect** | Stack skills + Technical design | `specs/stack/stack-skills.md`, `design.md` |
| **product-owner** | Functional specs, user stories | `specs/functional/` |
| **frontend-engineer** | UI + unit tests (BDD) | Code + `*.test.ts` |
| **backend-engineer** | API + unit tests (BDD) | Code + `*.test.ts` |
| **qa-engineer** | E2E or Integration tests | `e2e/` or custom path |
| **devops-engineer** | Ship, CI/CD, deploy, publish, monitor | Pipelines, Docker, npm |

> **Note:** Claude orchestrates directly. No learning-agent. Project detection is done by Claude.

### frontend-engineer — Presentation & User Interaction

| Responsibility | Any Stack |
|----------------|-----------|
| UI rendering | Components, views, templates, canvas, WebGL |
| User input | Forms, events, gestures, keyboard |
| Client-side state | UI state, caches, local storage |
| Display formatting | Dates, numbers, i18n for display |

### backend-engineer — Data & Business Logic

| Responsibility | Any Stack |
|----------------|-----------|
| API endpoints | REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket handlers |
| Data persistence | Database, file system, storage |
| Business rules | Domain services, calculations, validations |
| External systems | Third-party APIs, queues, workers |

### Decision Process (Stack-Agnostic)

```
ASK: "What is this code's PRIMARY responsibility?"

PRESENTATION / USER INTERACTION  →  frontend-engineer
├─ Displays something to user
├─ Handles user input
└─ Manages UI state

DATA / LOGIC / PERSISTENCE       →  backend-engineer
├─ Processes business rules
├─ Reads/writes data
└─ Communicates with external systems

WHEN IN DOUBT:
→ "If this was a human team, who would own this?"
→ Designer/UI dev → frontend | Data/API dev → backend
```

---

## Software Craft Principles

Non-negotiable rules for ALL agents:

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **No `any`** | Strict TypeScript, types are documentation |
| **No `throw`** | `Result<T, E>` — errors are values |
| **Domain isolation** | Hexagonal: domain has ZERO framework imports |
| **Colocated tests** | `*.test.ts` next to source (BDD style) |
| **Spec before code** | PO spec → Architect design → Dev implements |

## Directory Structure

```
.clean-claude/                         # GITIGNORED — operational only
├── context.json                       # Project detection cache
└── state.json                         # Session state (resume)

specs/                                 # COMMITTED ✅ — shared documentation
├── functional/                        # PO specs

```

**In monorepo:** `specs/` lives inside `{SCOPE}/specs/`
**Standalone:** `specs/` at project root

**Committed = shared with the team:**
- `specs/functional/` — Versioned functional specs

## Auto Architecture Capture

**First feature → Reference architecture for all future features.**

```
/craft "Create authentication µApp"
  │
  ├─ Implementation complete
  │
  └─ "First feature complete. Capture as reference architecture?"
       │
       ├─ Yes → Generate .clean-claude/architecture-guide.md
       │        Future µApps MUST follow this structure
       │
       └─ No → Skip (architecture guide created later)
```

### Monolith Consistency

For monoliths with multiple µApps:
- **First µApp** → Captures the reference architecture
- **All other µApps** → MUST follow the same patterns
- Architect reads `architecture-guide.md` BEFORE designing new features

---

## Philosophy

- **Learn first** — Know the stack AND validate CRAFT compliance before acting
- **Never learn from smells** — Reject anti-patterns, suggest fixes
- **Architecture consistency** — First feature = reference for all µApps
- **Smart routing** — Free text → right agent
- **Craft-first** — Software Craft in every line
- **Autonomous** — Agents fix without asking
- **Parallel** — Dev + QA work simultaneously
